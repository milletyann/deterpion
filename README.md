# deterpion
make the matrix invertible in Z/2Z
----------------------------------
Simple rules for a simple 2 players game: <br>
1- Choose the size of your matrix. <br>
2- Choose the defender and the attacker, the defender must prevent the matrix from becoming invertible, the attacker must make it invertible. <br>
3- Each in turn, add a 0 or a 1 (the matrix takes its values in Z/2Z) somewhere in the matrix. <br>
4- The defender wins if the matrix is not invertible, otherwise the attacker wins. <br>
5- Good luck! <br>

This game has been created by Alexis Gryson and his friends in ENS Cachan in the early 2000's.
