# deterpion
make the matrix invertible in Z/2Z
----------------------------------
Simple rules for a simple 2 players game:
1- Choose the size of your matrix. \n
2- Choose the defender and the attacker, the defender must prevent the matrix from becoming invertible, the attacker must make it invertible. \n
3- Each in turn, add a 0 or a 1 (the matrix takes its values in Z/2Z) somewhere in the matrix. \n
4- The defender wins if the matrix is not invertible, otherwise the attacker wins. \n
5- Good luck! \n

This game has been created by AG and his friends in the ENS of Cachan in the early 2000's.
